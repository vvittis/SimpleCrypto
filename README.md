# SimpleCrypto

This projects implements 3 crypto algorithms

1. One-time Pad
2. Caesar's Cipher
3. Vigenere's Cipher

## One-Time Pad

The OTP algorithm is a very simple but yet very strong algorithm in the sense that it can not be cracked even 
with post-quantum techniques.

## Caesar's Cipher

This technique is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.

## Vigenere's Cipher

The Vigenere's cipher encrypts an alphabetic plaintext using a series of interwoven Caesar's ciphers.
